## Hello!
This is my personal site. The project was completed to increase my online presence and give me a place to showcase my work, in a clean, custom, and easily updatable way.

## Tech Stack
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started
Click [here](https://www.spencerv.dev/) to visit the site!

To run it locally, clone the repository, run "npm install" within the cloned directory, and lastly call "npm run dev" to deploy the development server. By default it should be live on http://localhost:5000/.

## Challenges
The site has quite a unique and challenging design to implement well on all displays. However, by leveraging Svelte's amazing animation API and some clever CSS I am very happy with the end result.

## Possible Improvments
- Connect to CMS for easier content management.
- Though the site is semantic, some HTML tags could be more use specific.
- Safari has issue with Svelte's animation API in certain cases, resolving said would remove some content shifting issues.
